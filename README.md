## Overview

This project looks very simple, but it's helped me understand responsive design, the difference between em vs rem. I host this site in [vercel.com](https://404-page-nu.vercel.app/) and this my first time deploy any website live. By doing this project I increase my HTML and CSS knowledge. I will do other challenges as well.
